# Advanced E-commerce Platform Backend

## Overview

This project is the backend component of an advanced e-commerce platform. It is built using PHP and the Laravel framework, providing a robust foundation for an online marketplace that supports multiple vendors, user authentication, product management, order processing, payment integration, and more. The backend is designed to be scalable, secure, and maintainable, leveraging Laravelâ€™s powerful features to deliver a high-performance application.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Secure user authentication with role-based access control (Admin, Vendor, Customer).
- **Product Management:** Vendors can manage their products, including adding, updating, and deleting listings.
- **Order Management:** Customers can place orders, and the system handles the entire order lifecycle, from cart to payment and shipping.
- **Payment Integration:** Supports multiple payment gateways for secure transactions.
- **Review System:** Customers can leave reviews and ratings for products.
- **Category Management:** Products can be organized into categories and subcategories.
- **Inventory Management:** Tracks product inventory and supports multiple warehouse locations.
- **Coupon System:** Allows the creation and application of discount codes and promotional offers.
- **API-Ready:** Built with RESTful principles, ready to integrate with a front-end or mobile application.

## Technology Stack

### Core Technologies

- **PHP 8.x:** The core programming language used for building the application.
- **Laravel 11.x:** The web application framework that provides the structure and tools needed to build this project, including:
    - **Eloquent ORM:** For interacting with the database using an object-oriented approach.
    - **Blade Templating:** (If needed for any admin dashboard or simple view rendering).
    - **Artisan Console:** For running commands and automating tasks.

    - **`utf8mb4_bin`** collation used for case-sensitive fields like usernames and passwords.
- **Redis:** Used for caching, improving performance by reducing database load.

### Security

- **Laravel Sanctum:** For API authentication, allowing token-based authentication for SPAs and mobile applications.
- **Laravel Validation:** To ensure data integrity and security by validating user input.
- **CSRF Protection:** Cross-Site Request Forgery protection for all forms and requests.

### Additional Tools

- **Composer:** Dependency management for PHP, ensuring all required libraries and packages are up-to-date.
